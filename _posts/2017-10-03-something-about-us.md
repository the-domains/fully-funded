## Meet Lisa

The summer of 2017 marked my 25-year anniversary as a Cru staff member. I currently serve with the Digital Strategies team in the area of Spiritual Formation.

I am a wife, a mom to five wonderful kids whom I love parenting, a missionary, a spiritual director, and an author. Growing up in a Mormon family in Utah and coming to the Biblical Jesus in college has birthed a passion within me to possess good theology. Because God brought such a radical transformation in my life, I have a passion for journeying alongside others on their road of spiritual transformation.

I am in a **graduate studies** two-year program I began in August 2017 called [Renovare Institute for Spiritual Formation][0].

## Meet Dennis

The summer of 2018 marked my 35-year anniversary as a Cru staff member. It is my privilege to serve on our Global Digital Strategies team on which I focus on global branding and marketing.

I am a dad to five lively kids who are wonderful objects of interest for my photography hobby. Parenting them is a gift and as they grow into young adulthood, relating with them grows even richer.

I am passionate about the spiritual life and co-journeying with others who share the desire to know God intimately. I'm also passionate about how Christ is presented to the world, for how He's presented often determines whether or not one opens the door to listen to the transforming message of Christ.
